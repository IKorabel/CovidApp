**In 2020**, in the month of April, I developed one of the first applications dedicated to **COVID-19**. And so, a few weeks ago, I decided to do a full-fledged refactoring and redesign of the application in the style of **Apple**.
### App Features
- Access to worldwide COVID-19 statistics for today and all time
- Access to COVID statistics for each individual country and province of country
- Map with province COVID cases

### Development and design features
- The App was written using **MVC architecture**
- Apple Native Design using Human Interface Guidelines 
- Only fonts used by Apple
